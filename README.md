Project Description:
The "Modern Periodic Table Explorer" is a console-based application designed to provide users with information about the elements in the periodic table. The program allows users to explore details about each element, such as its name, symbol, atomic number, electronic configuration, the scientist who discovered it, and its charge.

Features:

Element Information: Users can input the atomic number of an element to retrieve comprehensive information about it.

Periodic Table Overview: Users can choose to learn about the periodic table as a whole.

User Interaction: The program incorporates user-friendly interactions, prompting users with options and responding accordingly.

Graceful Exit: Users are given the option to gracefully exit the program or continue exploring elements.

Technical Details:

Programming Language: C
Data Structure: Struct (for storing element information) and Array (to store information for all elements).
User Input Handling: The program uses scanf for user input and employs conditional statements for decision-making.
Error Handling: The program checks for valid atomic numbers and handles invalid input.
How to Use:

Launch the program.
Choose to explore information about a specific element or get an overview of the periodic table.
If exploring a specific element, enter the atomic number when prompted.
Optionally, choose to exit the program or continue exploring.
Purpose:
This project serves as an educational tool to help users learn about the elements in the periodic table. It provides a simple and interactive way for users to explore essential information about each element and understand the structure of the periodic table.

Note:
Ensure that the program includes the complete dataset for all 118 elements in the periodic table for accurate information retrieval.
